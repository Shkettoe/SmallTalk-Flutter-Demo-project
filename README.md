# Small Talk

*Weather forcasts with a twist*

## Concept

A social lubricant that acknowledges the absurdity of our collective obsession with the meteorological observations as a conversation filler.

I find it funny that we all agreed "nice weather" is a good conversation starter.

## Technologies
- Flutter
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Features
- Real-time weather data
- Location selection
- Weather condition preferences
- Small talk phrases related to the current weather at the location

## Running the app
Running the app requires a .env file with the OpenWeatherMap API key and an android virtual device.
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Or you can simply download the apk and run it on a real android device.
